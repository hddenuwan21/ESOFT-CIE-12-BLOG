                    <p>
                        That old cliche of doing what it says on tha tin rears its head here because the Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+ will do, well, 300mph+. More specifically, it managed 304mph when the French firm decided to unleash it at Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien test track.
                        <br><br>
                        This 1,600hp mega-machine doesn't officially hold the world record though, as it only did that run in one direction. To break the record you have to do it twice in opposite directions-which for whatever reason, Bugatti decided not to do.

                        <p>
                            Sometimes you really can’t beat a good old-fashioned V8 with a couple of turbos strapped to it, and the Hennessey Venom F5 proves this. The 6.6-litre twin-turbo lump puts out 1,817hp and 1,617Nm of torque, enough to launch it from 0-60mph in 2.6 seconds.
                            <br><br>
                            The highest top speed Hennessey have got from this all-American beast so far is 272mph, however they reckon it can go faster. How much faster? Well Hennessey wants to get over 300mph out of the Venom.

                            <p>The American SSC Tuatara (Too-ah-ta-ra in case you’re struggling) comes in second on this list, with a pretty respectable 286mph top speed. That said, it’s not without a little controversy.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                You see, SSC claimed the Tuatara actually managed 316mph in October 2020 to make it the world’s fastest car — but later admitted to a GPS error that depicted that speed wrongly. Later tests saw it hit a maximum of 286mph (it averaged 283mph over two runs.) Still not exactly slow, is it?

                                    Electric cars offer instant acceleration thanks to the torque from their electric motors, however the added weight of the batteries can limit them in terms of top speed. This isn’t the case for the Rimac Nevera though.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This ballistic EV hypercar has four electric motors, producing a whopping 1,914hp and 2,300Nm of torque. That’s enough to launch it from 0-60mph in just 1.9 seconds, and it can go on to a top speed of 258mph. It’s made almost entirely out of carbon fibre to keep the weight down, but this isn’t just some stripped-out drag racer. The interior is a lovely place to be and you still get all the luxuries you’d expect of a car that costs £2 million.

                                        McLaren didn’t design the Speedtail to chase world records, but, with a 250mph top speed, it’s the fastest road car it has ever built.

                                                    The Pagani Huayra is a fantastic looking car. Every detail is exquisite, and it’s more than just a pin-up as well. It has an AMG derived twin-turbocharged V12 engine putting out 730hp and 1,000Nm of torque, enough for a top speed of 238mph.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    The Huayra is made mostly of carbon fibre to keep the weight down, as well as to make it more rigid, and it’s covered in active aero to help it slip through the air more easily.

                                                        The fastest naturally-aspirated production car you can buy at the moment comes from the lunatics at Lamborghini. Not all that surprising, really.

                                                        The SVJ is the ultimate version of the Lamborghini Aventador supercar and produces a whopping 770hp from its 6.5-litre V12 engine. Its 217mph top speed is actually the same as the standard Aventador S, but the lighter and gripper SVJ will get there quicker and be faster around corners.

The Jesko Absolut is powered by a twin-turbocharged V8 producing 1,280hp on normal fuel, or a whopping 1,600hp on E85 race fuel.

                                                            This is enough for a 0-60mph sprint tome of 2.5 seconds. Koenigsegg hasn’t tested the top speed of the Jesko Absolut yet, however their computer simulations predict that it’ll do 310mph. We’ll have to wait and see what it can actually do before it can claim the top spot on this list.
